# Interests

[Horror Movies and Horror Games]

While she likes playing horror games herself, apparently she likes it better when she makes girls play horror games while enjoying their reactions and screams.

[During the 3D LizeLulu horror collab, she enjoyed seeing Lize Helesta's reaction so much that she almost couldn't control herself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-jrjqpoq2U)

She's not so fond of ghosts and apparitions because she can't hit them with physical attacks unlike zombies and such.

The reason for her liking horror is that her family really likes horror movies, and being able to see them so often made her enjoy them as well. The very first horror movie she watched was The Return of the Living Dead.

[She likes taking long baths, and she often watches horror movies while in the bath.](https://youtu.be/uZDF8OvozsI?t=4476)

She used to not like gore, but she developed an acquired taste after watching a lot of gory splatter horror films with her sister.

[She was considerate enough to ask the viewers if they're OK with blood turned on when she was fixing her settings in her Sekiro stream.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zILKNh1ji54)

[She had a dream where she turned into a zombie and ate her entire family in a gory manner.](https://youtu.be/18MWs8mTLOc?t=645)

While she likes all kinds of horror, she doesn't like horror houses and such.
Even in horror games, she doesn't like stuff that startle her like jumpscares. [She dislikes sudden loud sounds, like fireworks, so she isn't good with those either.](https://youtu.be/8RhXSCyH-uE?t=3230) ([In her Five Nights at Freddy's stream, she screamed quite a lot.](https://youtu.be/8RhXSCyH-uE?t=3060) ~~Thank you, jumpscares.~~)

[HUNTER×HUNTER]

Her favorite HUNTER×HUNTER character is Hisoka.

She can read and write the Hunter alphabet.

Tried Water Divination to check for her type of Nen. [She didn't notice any change and tried to taste the water to check if that also changed,](https://youtu.be/0383InXnA8g?t=1941) but nothing happened so she just concluded she's a Specialist leaning towards Enhancer.

In the Water Divination Test stream of Tsukino Mito and Yashiro Kizuku, Suzuhara Lulu said that the name of her Nen ability is Endless Time. When fighting an enemy, Endless Time causes the user to repeatedly rise up and fight until they win, with the sole weakness of the user shortening their lifespan.

[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]

Her favorite JoJo part is Part 3: Stardust Crusaders.

Her favorite characters are Giorno Giovanna and Bruno Bucciarati.

Her favorite Stand is Vanilla Ice's Cream.

Apparently she thinks Araki's art is appealing.

In her streams she always references DIO's Stand, The World, when she pauses the game (usually when she's about to fall to her death). (*)She also frequently referenced Killer Queen's Bites the Dust when she undid her actions when playing Reversi in Clubhouse 51 Games.

[Spicy Food]

She likes eating spicy food.

The limit of the spicy food she can eat is Mouko Tanmen Nakamoto's North Pole ramen.

She can eat CoCo Ichibanya's curry at spicy level 4, but for her spicy level 10 is painful. (NOTE: not on the wiki, but if I remember correctly, she ate level 10 during LizeLulu Listen. I'll provide a source later.)

[Physical Activity]

She likes doing physical activity.

[She can't swim, but she has a diving license.](https://youtu.be/RqPl7CxMxNw?t=6150) [She also had some experience with riding horses.](https://youtu.be/5JtRiv4iOvQ?t=4666)(she mentioned in a recent stream that she could do dog paddles)

[She went to the gym 3-4 times a week, with each session lasting 3-4 hours, for an entire year.](https://youtu.be/iHUzMDq8KSM?t=7600)

Her body is so flexible that she can bend forward with her arms stretched until her palms lay flat on the floor. (note: I can visualize it just fine but this probably needs a better translation)

She likes running. [When she was in elementary school she was last in short sprints but she got first place on a marathon.](https://youtu.be/rg0UxxfeTn4?t=3476)

She did an endurance Ring Fit Adventure stream to know her limits. She stopped after ten hours not because she was tired, but because she wanted to take a bath.

Other Nijisanji Livers participating in Virtual to Live Ryougoku praised her for her crisp Yharnam steps. (note: I want to remove Yharnam step and replace it with just dancing, but I'm keeping the original text if people are ok with the JP wiki memes. will add the livers' comments about her dancing in a later date)

Her movements were smoother in Shine in the Rainbow, and she was able to sing 5 songs.(note: I will add the livers' comments about her dancing in a later date)

[She did both singing and dance covers for Koi and Renai Circulation in her 3D stream.](https://youtu.be/29nfCCThT2k)

[Sharks and Dinosaurs]

[She said likes dinosaurs so much that she was called Dr. Dinosaur(恐竜博士) when she was little.](https://youtu.be/g_xqRzNC_yg?t=4680) Her deep knowledge about dinosaurs can be seen in her Animal Crossing and Maneater streams.

Her favorite shark is the hammerhead shark because she thinks it's cool.
[Her favorite dinosaur is the pachycephalosaurus (aka Pachy-chan)](https://youtu.be/20XvTQxIsLk?t=2820), and she imitated its headbutt when she used to play dinosaur with Anehara.

[Gundam]

She likes them because her father builds Gunplas, and they built some Gunplas together in the past. The first Gunpla she built was Dom, and her favorite Mobile Suit is Gouf.

No one at her class likes Gundam so she never had anyone else to talk about it in school.

# Personal Life

[Suzuhara Lulu and Beverages]

She always drinks jasmine tea on her streams. Bottles of various sizes of jasmine tea are stocked in her fridge. (She recently purchased a water server, so she drinks mostly water now.)

She feels tingly when she drinks cola. As Debidebi Debiru said, "That's a proof of being a demon."

[Suzuhara Lulu's Eye Condition]

She has bad eyesight so she always wears contact lenses. (Her visual acuity is around 0.02 with astigmatism. She bought eyeglasses on September 4, 2019.)

In her 11th Bloodborne stream, her right eye hurt due to streaming very long hours so she "replaced" it a few times. In a DebiLulu collab she said that even if her eye gets crushed it will always regenerate.

[When she visited her eye doctor](https://twitter.com/lulu_suzuhara/status/1282632435323203584) in July 13, 2020, she couldn't see the eye test chart's topmost letter C with her bare eyes so she was diagnosed with high myopia.

When she visited her eye doctor again in August 4, 2020, [she was diagnosed with giant papillary conjunctivitis and glaucoma.](https://youtu.be/FyDbsVgDeEw?t=342) While she still needs to go for check-ups regularly to monitor her eye's condition, [she said that her eye condition won't affect her streaming and daily life.](https://youtu.be/FyDbsVgDeEw?t=411)

[Suzuhara Lulu and Sleep]

She is a short sleeper, so 3-4 hours of sleep is enough for her.
In her 4th Mega Man X stream, she said that recently she could do just fine with 1-2 hours of sleep.

Her 4th Hollow Knight stream lasted 18 hours, and on the same day, [she took a nap a little over than an hour](https://twitter.com/lulu_suzuhara/status/1173236114510893056) and caused her to be late for her 2nd Kirby stream. She streamed Kirby for 3 hours.

Because it was really rare for her to be late for the stream, her stream had around 3000 people waiting and they were writing comments such as "I see you're human after all" and "Knowing you sleep makes me feel secure". In the end, her father and sister were worried and called her phone to wake her up, and she started streaming Kirby after a 30-minute delay.

[She always wears pajamas as sleepwear, but she also wears T-shirts from her favorite horror movies and video games sometimes.](https://youtu.be/uZDF8OvozsI?t=4973)

[Suzuhara Lulu and Alcohol]

She had her first taste of alcohol on her 20th birthday where she drank wine with her family.

[She streamed her 21st birthday by celebrating with cakes and alcohol.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1Lq9WgP6u0) [She streamed Sekiro afterward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh9gYUMgMHI) and she forgot to display [the end card she prepared](https://twitter.com/lulu_suzuhara/status/1143198973135507461), possibly due to being a bit inebriated.
She celebrated her new outfit(yukata) by drinking on stream. [She then streamed Bloodborne and accidentally killed an NPC right after she started the stream](https://youtu.be/0ik6JT5bRow?t=130) and said "I got too excited with the costume". (The people in chat replied, "Not because you're drunk!?")

[Suzuhara Lulu's Family]

[She said she's the most dependable/responsible in her family. (She said that everyone else is pretty absent-minded.)](https://youtu.be/iHUzMDq8KSM?t=1202)

She explained how responsible she is by saying she never loses the house key and always makes sure the house is locked before she leaves (~~Anehara...~~); although, there was also an instance where she mistakenly put a controller in her bag when she went outside.

[She was made fun by her father, Chichihara, through LINE with a crying emoji](https://youtu.be/oUX3L2sTdPA?t=3300) [after she misread the word antipyretic, 解熱剤(genetsuzai), by reading it as (kainetsuzai).](https://youtu.be/10sxjm3EMBI?t=4966)\
[Chichihara once sent her a marshmallow.](https://youtu.be/JBuuK7tTTug?t=1620) (Her father confirmed this.)

[Finally, both Anehara and Chichihara appeared in her Momotetsu stream (with their mics turned on!)](https://youtu.be/w0PnnNtGuss?t=457)

[Suzuhara Lulu and Kanji]

[She was made fun by her father through LINE with a crying emoji after she misread the word antipyretic, 解熱剤(genetsuzai), by reading it as (kainetsuzai).]

[She thought the word "hinge" (蝶番) means something about butterflies(蝶) because of the butterfly(蝶) kanji in it.](https://youtu.be/g_xqRzNC_yg?t=3206)

[Suzuhara Lulu's Health]

[She said she gets more energetic when she catches a fever.](https://youtu.be/rg0UxxfeTn4?t=2700)

While she used to have a poor constitution in the past, it changed around 2-3 years ago and her normal body temperature rose up to ~~47~~ 37 degrees Celsius. She doesn't catch a cold except for the times she gets tonsillitis around once a year. (She had tonsillitis and went on a break for ten days in May 2020)

She thought of stocking up on food due to the typhoon and she ate some raw chopped up vegetables that were past their best before date. She didn't feel well and went to the hospital so she missed a stream. [She then apologized in the following stream for making her viewers worried.](https://youtu.be/8Sh8NY2YSs0?t=300)

[Suzuhara Lulu and Snacks]

[When she was little she used to eat Chateraise's mille crepe by eating it from the top by peeling it.](https://youtu.be/M1Lq9WgP6u0?t=1399) Her parents told her it's bad manners to eat in such manner she shouldn't do that in public.\
[She crushes the lemon inside Sacre's lemon ice cream with a spoon before eating it.](https://youtu.be/Ovaom9COOeU?t=415)\
[She likes freezing Meiji Apollo chocolate candies before eating them.](https://youtu.be/OxyhBNJC2Zg?t=6915)

When she's asked whether she's on the Mushroom Mountain team or the Bamboo Shoot Village team, ([Japanese pop culture context](https://japantoday.com/category/features/food/rivalry-between-mushrooms-and-bamboo-shoots-in-japan-as-people-vote-for-their-favorite-chocolate)) [she said she likes the bamboo shoots more](https://youtu.be/SK11UOxl_2Y?t=3540). However, after a very difficult battle with a bamboo-shoot-shaped enemy in Cuphead, she considered switching sides.

[Suzuhara Lulu's Pets Owned History]

Hamsters. [She said they really multiply a lot.](https://youtu.be/jD76ogmhF1c?t=2775)

Three rabbits. [One Netherland dwarf, one lop-eared rabbit, and one dwarf rabbit.](https://youtu.be/cISOLcEmA10?t=3732)\
[She said rabbits are so cute she almost wanted to eat them and that she starts drooling when she sees them.](https://youtu.be/cj9GCw4hBC8?t=3620)(~~Roa-chan please run away...~~)

A bearded dragon.


[Lulu Shinkyo]

(*)Lulu Shinkyo mean's Lulu's new home.

[When she was looking for a place to move she was introduced to a stigmatized property.](https://youtu.be/8Sh8NY2YSs0?t=300)

She felt uncomfortable about the place so she looked it up on Oshimaland (a website that has information about stigmatized property), she found out shocking information about it so she never trusted the real estate agent ever since.
