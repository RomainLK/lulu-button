[Gamer Suzuhara Lulu]

Nothing on her official introduction and bio says about her being a hardcore gamer, so it's a huge surprise to people coming in to see her stream for the first time that she's the kind of gamer who repeatedly plays the same game without getting burnt out.

[Games with her older sister Anehara]

She always watched Anehara play video games when they were little, so she also began to love video games herself. 
The first game Anehara recommended her to play is Fatal Frame.

At the time it took her *two years* to beat the game (she said she only really played it during her days off), but when she played it for the second time with Debidebi Debiru in a collab stream, it only took them 2 days.

The only games she couldn't clear in the DS she borrowed from Anehara are the Kanji test and English test. [She talked about how she **absolutely** won't do brain exercises.](https://youtu.be/JfLsL9kBe9g?t=1580) However, she promised to play brain exercises because she wanted to make up for a previous streaming accident, so [she delivered and kept her promise by borrowing Anehara's DS and streaming Brain Age.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBqtdtOzmcc)

[In the past, during the weekends, she and Anehara would often go to the Internet cafe, buy a 10-hour package, and play Ragnarok Online.](https://youtu.be/rg0UxxfeTn4?t=4760) The other online game they played was Monster Hunter Frontier.

[While she never lost a game against Anehara in Puyo Puyo Tetris as Puyo Puyo, she got absolutely wrecked as Tetris, so she streamed Puyo Puyo Tetris to practice.](https://youtu.be/Sj1N_YSAQ9Q?t=677) (Note: After checking the stream timestamp the JP wiki source is not that consistent with what she said, but Lulu is very good at Puyo Puyo so it might be the case.)

[Suzuhara Lulu and Monster Hunter]

[She had said her total recorded play hours in Monster Hunter was sickeningly long.](https://youtu.be/EXqAw4zPtM0?t=5770)

[She played **a lot** of Monster Hunter on the PSP, although she said she never got really good at the game.](https://youtu.be/zeg7DlqzCV4?t=1746)
The other platforms where she played Monster Hunter were the DS and the PS4. The weapons she used are the Twin Blades and the Bow.
[She played on the PSP so much that its LCD died out.](https://youtu.be/JBuuK7tTTug?t=6148)

[Solo Player Suzuhara Lulu]

[When she was younger, the only other person she plays video games with was her sister, and because she enjoys quietly playing games alone she played Mario Party by herself.](https://youtu.be/iHUzMDq8KSM?t=6070)

[She said she wasn't good at playing Tic-Tac-Toe because she only played it alone in the school playground when she was little.](https://youtu.be/NyqriwA3x_c?t=3067)

[Suzuhara Lulu's Preparation]

[She maxed out her lives off stream to prepare for an extremely difficult stage in Donkey Kong Country 2 (Animal Land).](https://twitter.com/lulu_suzuhara/status/1132254356990963713) (*)Not only that, she drank Red Bull before starting the stream to psych herself up.

[In Megaman X, she farmed extra lives to prepare for a difficult stage.](https://twitter.com/lulu_suzuhara/status/1145991936366432257)
[She didn't know that the game doesn't save the extra lives so she was shocked to see that the extra lives she farmed were gone.]

[During the Fatal Frame collab with Debidebi Debiru, she wanted to see the true ending and perfect clear the game so they tried and tried again to trigger the event that unlocks the ending through beating a boss with strict conditions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRer4kGBtto)

[In her Bloodborne stream, she stocked up on healing items until they maxed out before challenging a very difficult boss again.](https://youtu.be/5JtRiv4iOvQ?t=320)

[She looked up guides and wrote out notes for the event triggers that unlock the Shura ending in Sekiro.](https://youtu.be/v3ZfnPNveF4?t=15796)

(*) She and her teammates (Kuzuha, Fuwa Minato, and Honma Himawari) had the longest practice hours for the Fall Guys VTuber Party.

[Rapid Fire Suzuhara Lulu]

She is proud of her button mashing ability. [It seems like she feels secure when she does button mashing.](https://youtu.be/8iIxAakli3c?t=6236)
[Her third controller wasn't able to endure her button mashing that it broke in less than a week after buying it.](https://youtu.be/jYdBcx96hXI?t=1650) （３代目のコントローラーin the original text, someone confirm）

[Suzuhara Lulu's Hat]

She takes off her hat when she goes into serious mode.
[She said that taking her hat off **feels** like she's 50 kilograms lighter.](https://youtu.be/IqpGEdn_unc?t=14910) (note: 体感 is used in the source so I translated it as "feel" and not "her hat weighs 50kg", confirm with the link in the JP wiki to check)

[Suzuhara Lulu's Brain on Video Games]

[She said her starting to see choices pop out sometimes in the real world could be attributed to her playing too much video games](https://youtu.be/rg0UxxfeTn4?t=5520)

[Suzuhara Lulu Hates Losing]

Suzuhara Lulu is a person who dislikes losing. Below are some of the moments where she displays this trait.

Super Ghouls and Ghosts:

She couldn't clear the 1st stage within her planned stream duration (1 hour) so she asked during the stream if she could stream the game again after a 1-hour break. She was able to clear the stage shortly after starting the second stream.

Resident Evil 2 Remake:

[She displayed *some* annoyance and frustration after being prompted by the game to lower the difficulty after dying too many times against a difficult boss.](https://youtu.be/oiyuDalA_eA?t=2080)

Donkey Kong Country 3:

[After her clear time in a time-attack stage was made fun of by an NPC, she repeated the stage until she set a new record.](https://youtu.be/8gjCaVH8Enk?t=4816)

Tongue Twisters:

[In one chatting stream she was sent a marshmallow that challenges her to do some tongue twisters. She attempted to do the challenge multiple times until she got the tongue twisters right. ~~Despite her clearing them the success rate was quite low.~~](https://youtu.be/M1Lq9WgP6u0?t=4140)

Monster Hunter World:

[She repeatedly challenged Maimoto Keisuke to an arm wrestling match until the latter broke his nail during their Monster Hunter World collab stream with Onomachi Haruka.](https://youtu.be/jU_31qzuVjU?t=960) (note: I was trying to incorporate the "breaking parts" mechanic from the original JP text in this sentence, but the reference gets lost in translation. This probably needs and edit.)

Super Mario Maker 2:

[After failing one stage too many times, she was asked by Luigi if he could take over and play the game in her stead. This, of course, caused her to get *slightly* irritated.](https://youtu.be/FgrFfB-MCoI?t=5908)

Cuphead:

[She was just supposed to do a sneak peek on one stage but she ended up replaying the entire stage until she cleared it.](https://youtu.be/SK11UOxl_2Y?t=9156)

Super Mario 64:

She displayed her tenacity in doing difficult stages repeatedly until she clears them in stages [1-2](https://youtu.be/M9Fjw6jf7U4?t=6810) and [4-3](https://youtu.be/M9Fjw6jf7U4?t=6810).

Dark Souls 2:

[She konlulu'd Maldron the Assassin after the latter taunted her with gestures on top of backstabbing her.](https://youtu.be/v4L5uoEk6Fw?t=21714)

Rhythm Heaven Fever:

[She displayed her frustration through button mashing because she couldn't perfect the fork stage.](https://youtu.be/Mo9f3E9FmdQ?t=2520)

[Suzuhara Lulu and Lag]

She played games notable for their high difficulty (Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts, Donkey Kong Country 1 and 2, Castlevania IV, Sekiro) with lag and limited screen size because she only had one monitor and had to watch her capture footage through OBS.
(*)The last stream she played with lag was her fifth Sekiro stream on June 7, 2019, where she defeated Lady Butterfly within 14 attempts.
Her second monitor arrived on June 8, 2019 and the first stream she played lag-free was her third and final Splatterhouse stream.

[Suzuhara Lulu and Flags]

She often jinxes herself *immediately* after saying some inspirational stuff or when she's talking about how she's progressing well in the game. (Usually by falling)
She usually tilts her head in a slanting position and looks straight, eyes wide open, to the viewer after a careless misplay that causes her to die.

[Suzuhara Lulu's Stomach Growl]

Her stomach sometimes growls when she's streaming.
[She immediately admits that her stomach is growling when it's audible because if she stayed silent she'd get more embarrassed.](https://youtu.be/rg0UxxfeTn4?t=2247) ~~Suzuhara Lulu wants to eat hum—.~~ (this was included in the original source, I'll remove it if it's too much of a meme)

[Suzuhara Lulu's Random Cute Singing]

She always has the habit of singing something randomly/saying something in a singsong manner during her streams.
For example: Na~nka naika, nankanaika♪ or Yattatta♪Yattatta♪

[Encore!]

Because she has the tendency to do very long streams, [she once said she wanted a day to have around 72 hours.](https://youtu.be/ESxDh4mpyvo?t=720) It looks like she still isn't used to the hours in the human realm!
(the JP wiki is full of memes...)

When she's about to end the stream she always gets an encore from the chat, hoping she plays some more. This is often followed by a Final Last Encore, or other variants (depending on how many times she got an encore)

In her Mojipittan stream she found a word that sounds like her name, "ruru"（縷縷）, which means "continuing without pause".
[It's really just like her streams.](https://youtu.be/XK0oPIg8_VM?t=10120)

[Suzuhara Lulu and Spiders]

[The normally calm and collected Suzuhara Lulu loses her composure every time she sees spiders in games.](https://youtu.be/C5WSkGTht2o?t=2021) She said the reason for her fear of spiders was the spider movie she saw as a kid, and that they have too many eyes and legs.

(*)The first time she saw a spider on stream was in her first Donkey Kong Country 2 stream where she first encountered Squitter, an Animal Friend ally. Then she explained how she's okay with bugs in general as long as they're not spiders.

[In her Dark Souls 2 stream, she started singing and such to shake off her fear when she needed to get past a cluster of spiders to get an item.](https://youtu.be/GyMJSP55cp0?t=715)

[In her Rhythm Heaven stream, there was a spider-like insect in a stage where you have to sort items. She panicked and froze for a moment after seeing it.](https://youtu.be/DOd1d-PDYVw?t=12160) (*)The moment she touched the spider-like creature she said "Disgusting."

[In her Katamari Damacy stream, right after she saw a spider web she hurriedly went past through it, but she was prompted to go back and get it.](https://youtu.be/bE0DecJp8N8?t=3685)

[When she was in elementary school, when Anehara tried to prank her with spiders, they had had a serious fight that caused her to leave the house for more than 3 hours. She didn't talk to Anehara for a week after.](https://youtu.be/uZDF8OvozsI?t=5910)

[Suzuhara Lulu's Memory]

Suzuhara Lulu couldn't remember the names of her opponents well.

Despite fighting the same enemy for hours, she couldn't remember their name so it's not rare for her to ask for their name right after beating them. She's too focused on the fight she doesn't even recognize the names of her opponents, and it looks like she loses interest in them right after beating them. (original source kinda weird, needs some checking)

[Her sense of direction is so terrible she often gets lost even in places she just previously went to. She said that although she often gets lost in games, she has never gotten lost in real life.](https://youtu.be/hTc629Bvez0?t=3120)

[Luluspeak]

She always inflects her words with -lulu on purpose, usually on verbs ending with ru.
Examples: ohalulu, ganbalulu, arigalulu, inoruru, ikichi wo susururu; there's other cases like luluoboe from the word urooboe

・Konlulu

TL Note: Konlulu is always used as a noun or verb. (it's possible to use the word to describe things, as an adjective or adverb, but so far she hasn't done it yet)

The word "Konlulu"/「こんるる～」 is used in a multiple ways including, but not limited to: first time meeting an enemy, striking first, attacking the opponent by surprise

・Special usage of the word Konlulu (Lost Ember stream)

One new definition of the word "Konlulu" is "the flow of souls", [used when she was transferring her soul between various animals in Lost Ember.](https://youtu.be/-xC2uR-5iVc?t=915) 

Note:
魂流流/魂流々 from 魂/soul and 流/flow or current 
流流/流々 means "style" or "workmanship"; however, this isn't the case for Konlulu and is read as "flow flow" instead.

・(*)Replacing words with the small tsu っ in it with a big tsu つ on purpose.

Example: "modotsute"もどつて from the word "modotte"/戻って

・(*)Calling NPCs/enemies/bosses "children" (my entry)

She uses the phrase この子/this child every time she refers to someone in game.

・(*)Using the Japanese counter word for small animals 匹 when counting human/humanoid characters instead of 人

Example: Instead of using five people/５人, she'll use five critters/５匹 instead when counting people in game.



[[Konlulu Time Bomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWTuz8JA8C8)]

When Kagami Hayato asked for new toy ideas for his company in one collab stream, Suzuhara Lulu gave a sales pitch about her product Konlulu Time Bomb. Ever since, 「こん...こん...」/"Kon... Kon..." has been used by the chat when the her stream is about to start (always 3 minutes prior start time) to imitate a ticking time bomb.

[Suzuhara Lulu's Thumbnails and End Cards]

Her creative and unique thumbnails and end cards gained a lot of attention from her viewers that her talent for making them is called "art student's artistic sense".

She said that when she was still starting it took her about two hours to make thumbnails, but by the time she hit 50k subscribers making thumbnails only took her around an hour. (context: she said this in her 50k subs chatting stream so maybe that's why it's written like this in the source)

70% of the time she makes her thumbnails on her PC through Photoshop, and 30% of the time she makes them on her smartphone through ibisPaint.

Her favorite thumbnail is the one used for her third Super Ghouls 'N Ghost stream. 

[She said that she enjoys coming up with new thumbnail ideas and likes hearing everyone's reactions to them.](https://youtu.be/aCZnDa-7Xvw?t=1700)

There are quite a lot of people within Nijisanji who praise her thumbnail-making skills.
Here are some of the comments by other streamers:

Takamiya Rion: [I like the thumbnails from these parts (when she Lulu still new), Ah, these are irresistibly good!](https://youtu.be/byAQlOzP9ag?t=2970)

Maimoto Keisuke: [Suzuhara Lulu's thumbnail making is already a talent itself.](https://youtu.be/cZJxMd0UHGs?t=1090)

Debidebi Debiru: [I like the images this girl makes so much.](https://twitter.com/debidebiru_sama/status/1130378339338743808)

Lize Helesta: [It is seriously really unique.](https://youtu.be/xJ1zEYsQs4w?t=430)

[Pink is No Good]

[This is what her customer told her when she put her Kirby painting on saie in Passpartout.](https://youtu.be/gjpjyPNIi2c?t=5870) Hearing such criticism was shocking to her and the viewers that when the color pink shows up/gets mentioned in her streams the chat spams "Pink is no good./ピンクはあかん"

[Youtube Gaming Week]

VTuber Fall Guys Party:

She participated in a Fall Guys tournament featuring 26 VTubers including herself, and her team is named くるみわり/Kurumiwari (literally means nutcracker in Japanese), comprising the team members' names: Ku-zuha, Lu-lu, Mi-nato, Hima-wari.

In the tournament, Honma Himawari won two crowns by herself, and the team won by a landslide, outdoing the 2nd place team by 16 points. Her level of excitement was exceedingly higher than usual that she let out a shout for joy, something that's very rarely seen from her streams.

Try! PS5:

She participated in a sneak peek of the PS5, in which her Nijisanji colleague Mayuzumi Kai also participated (in their own respective channels). Despite her participating in the sneak peek, she didn't win the preorder lottery for the PS5 so she still doesn't have the console.
