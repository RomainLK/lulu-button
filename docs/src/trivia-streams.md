[Games with Anehara]
Nothing about her official introduction and bio says about her being a hardcore gamer, so it's a huge surprise to people coming in to see her stream for the first time that she's the kind of gamer who repeatedly plays the same game without getting burnt out.
While she's watching her sister play games she herself also became a gamer.
The first game her sister recommended her to play is Fatal Frame.
At the time it took her *two years* to beat the game (she said she only really played it during her days off), but when she played it for the second time with Debidebi Debiru in a collab stream, it only took them 2 days.
The only games she couldn't clear in the DS she borrowed from her sister are the Kanji test and English test. She talked about how she absolutely won't do brain exercises.
However, she promised to play brain exercises because she wanted to make up for a previous streaming accident, so she delivered and kept her promise by borrowing her sister's DS and streaming Brain Age.
In the past, during the weekends, she and her sister used to go to the Internet cafe, buy a 10-hour package, and play Ragnarok Online. The other online game they played was Monster Hunter Frontier.

[Suzuhara Lulu's Monster Hunter]
She had said her recorded play hours in Monster Hunter was sickening.
She played a lot of Monster Hunter on the PSP, although she said she never got really good at the game.
The other platforms where she played Monster Hunter were the DS and the PS4. The weapons she used are the Twin Blades and the Bow.
She played on the PSP so much that its LCD died out.

[Solo Player Suzuhara Lulu]
When she was younger, the only other person she plays video games with was her sister, and because she enjoys quietly playing games alone she played Mario Party (a multiplayer game) by herself.
She said she wasn't good at playing Tic-Tac-Toe because she played it alone in the school playground when she was little.

[Suzuhara Lulu's Preparation]
To prepare for a VERY difficult stage in Donkey Kong Country 2, she maxed out her lives prior to starting the stream. Not only that, she drank Red Bull before starting the stream to psych herself up. (some random shit: she wasn't able to finish Animal Land in her first Donkey Kong Country Lost World stream, and it actually took her 3 hours to beat the stage)
In Megaman X, she grinded lives to prepare for a difficult stage. (https://twitter.com/lulu_suzuhara/status/1145991936366432257)
She didn't know that the game doesn't save the extra lives so when she started the stream she was shocked to see that the lives she grinded were gone.
During the Fatal Frame collab with Debidebi Debiru, she wanted to see the true ending and perfect clear the game so they tried and tried again to trigger the event that unlocks the ending through a boss. (needs qc/tlc)
In her Bloodborne stream, she stocked up on healing items until they maxed out before challenging a very difficult boss again.
She wrote out notes for the event triggers that unlock the Shura ending in Sekiro.
(my entry:) She and her teammates (Kuzuha, Fuwa Minato, and Honma Himawari) had the longest practice hours in preparation for the Fall Guys VTuber Party.

[Rapid Fire Suzuhara Lulu]
She is always proud of her button mashing ability. She feels secure when she does button mashing.
Her third controller wasn't able to endure her button mashing that it broke in less than a week after buying it.

[Suzuhara Lulu's Hat]
She takes off her hat when she goes into serious mode.
She said that taking her hat off **feels** like she's 50 kilograms lighter. (note since 体感 is used in the source I think her hat itself has no absolute weight) (confirm with the link associated with this entry)

[Suzuhara Lulu's Brain on Video Games]
She said that her seeing choices in the real world might be attributed to her playing too much video games.

[Suzuhara Lulu Hates Losing]
Suzuhara Lulu is a person who dislikes losing. Here are some of the moments where she displays this trait.

Super Ghouls and Ghosts
She couldn't clear the 1st stage within her planned stream duration (1 hour) so she asked during the stream if she could stream the game again after a 1-hour break. She was able to clear the stage shortly after starting the second stream.

Resident Evil 2 Remake
She displayed a bit of annoyance and frustration after being prompted by the game to lower the difficulty after dying too many times against a difficult boss.

Donkey Kong Country 3
After her clear time in a time-attack stage was made fun of by an NPC, she repeated the stage until she set a new record.

Tongue Twisters
In one chatting stream she was sent a marshmallow that challenges her to do some tongue twisters. She attempted to do the challenge multiple times until she got the tongue twisters right. --Despite her clearing them the success rate was quite low.--

Monster Hunter World
She repeatedly challenged Maimoto Keisuke until the latter broke his nail during their Monster Hunter World collab stream. (I'm trying to incorporate the "breaking parts" reference from the original text in this sentence but I guess it's lost in translation. Needs an edit.)

Super Mario Maker 2
After failing one stage too many times, she was asked by Luigi if he could take over and play the game in her stead. This, of course, caused her to get slightly irritated.

Cuphead
She was just about to do a "sneak peek" on one stage but she ended up retrying the stage until she cleared it.

Super Mario 64
She displayed her tenacity in doing difficult stages repeatedly until she clears them in stages 1-2 and 4-3.

Dark Souls 2
She konlulued Maldron the Assassin after the latter taunted her with gestures and backstabbed her.

Rhythm Heaven Fever
She displayed her frustration through button mashing because she couldn't perfect the fork stage.

[Suzuhara Lulu and Lag]
She played games notable for their high difficulty (Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts, Donkey Kong Country 1 and 2, Castlevania IV, Sekiro) with lag and limited screen size because she only had one monitor and had to watch her capture footage through OBS.
The last stream she played with lag was her fifth Sekiro stream on June 7, 2019, where she beat Lady Butterfly in 14 attempts.
Her second monitor arrived on June 8, 2019 and the first stream she played lag-free was her third and final Splatterhouse stream.

She often jinxes herself *immediately* after saying some inspirational stuff or when she's talking about how she's progressing well in the game. (Usually by falling)
She usually tilts her head in a slanting position and looks straight, eyes wide open, into the viewer after a misplay or a careless mistake that causes her to die.

[Suzuhara Lulu's Stomach Growl]
Her stomach often growls when she's streaming.
She immediately admits that her stomach is growling because if it's audible and she didn't say anything she'd get more embarrased. --Suzuhara Lulu wants to eat humans.-- (I want the Scripture to be free of memes, why would my JP nikis do this?)

[Suzuhara Lulu's Random Cute Singing]
She always has the habit of singing something randomly/saying something in a singsong manner during her streams.
For example: Na~nka naika, nakanaika♪ or Yattatta♪Yattatta♪

[Encore!]
Since she has the tendency to do very long streams, she once said she wanted a day to have 72 hours, looks like she isn't used to the hours in the human realm!
(the original text sounds like a meme and I really don't want to include it, think it's more "serious" and helpful if we exclude this part)

When she's about to end the stream she always gets an encore from the chat, hoping she plays some more. This is often followed by a Final Last Encore, or other variants (depending on how many times she got an encore)

In her Mojipittan stream she found a word that sounds like her name, "ruru"（縷縷）, which means "continuing without pause".
(link)It's really just like her streams.

[Suzuhara Lulu and Spiders]

The normally calm and collected Suzuhara Lulu loses her composure every time she sees a spider in the games.

Super random trivia(by me): The first time she saw a spider on stream was in her first Donkey Kong Country 2 stream where she first encountered Squitter, an Animal Friend ally. Then she explained how she's okay with bugs in general as long as they're not spiders.
(more explanations below)

In her Dark Souls 2 stream, she started singing to shake off her fear when she needed to get past a cluster of spiders to get an item.

In her Rhythm Heaven stream, there was a spider-like insect in a stage where you have to sort items. She panicked and froze for a moment after seeing it. (The moment she touched the spider she said "disgusting")

In her Katamari Damacy stream, right after she saw a spider web she hurriedly went past through it and she was prompted to go back.

When she was in elementary school, when her sister tried to prank her with spiders, (practical joke context? needs better English) they had had a serious quarrel that caused her to leave the house for more than 3 hours. After that, she didn't talk to her sister for a week.

[Suzuhara Lulu's Memory]

Suzuhara Lulu couldn't remember the names of her opponents well.

Despite fighting the same enemy for hours, she couldn't remember their name so it's not rare for her to ask for their name right after beating them. (the following sentences look like speculation?:) She's too focused on the fight she doesn't even consider the names of her opponents, and it looks like she loses interests in them right after beating them. (although this isn't the case actually)

Her sense of direction is so terrible she often gets lost even in places she previously went to.
She said that although she often gets lost in games, she has never gotten lost in real life.

[Luluspeak]
She always inflects her words with -lulu on purpose, usually on verbs ending with ru.
Examples: ohalulu, ganbalulu, arigalulu, inoruru, ikichi wo susururu; there's other cases like luluoboe from the word urooboe

・Konlulu (see my dictionary entry for more information)
Note: Konlulu is always used as a noun or verb. (although it's possible to use it to describe things like adjectives or adverbs, but there are no cases of that usage so far)
The word "Konlulu"/「こんるる～」 is used in a multiple ways including, but not limited to: first time meeting an enemy, striking first, attacking the opponent by surprise

・Special usage of the word Konlulu
One special usage of the word "Konlulu" is when it's used to describe the "flow" of souls, like when transferring souls
(Translator's note:)
魂流流/魂流々 from 魂/soul and 流/flow or current 
Do note that while 流流/流々 means "style" or "workmanship", this isn't the case for Konlulu and is read as "flow flow" instead.

・Replacing words the small tsu っ with a big tsu つ on purpose. (my entry)
Example: "modotsute"もどつて from the word "modotte"/戻って

[Konlulu Time Bomb]
When Kagami Hayato asked for new toy ideas for his company in one collab stream, Suzuhara Lulu gave a sales pitch about her product Konlulu Time Bomb. Ever since, 「こん...こん...」/"Kon... Kon..." has been used by the chat when the her stream is about to start (almost always 3 minutes prior start time) to imitate a ticking time bomb.

[Suzuhara Lulu's Thumbnails and End Cards]
Her creative and unique thumbnails and end cards gained a lot of attention from her viewers that her talent for making them is called "art student's artistic sense".

She said that when she was still starting it took her about two hours to make thumbnails, but by the time she hit 50k subscribers making thumbnails only took her around an hour. (context: she said this in her 50k subs chatting stream so maybe that's why it's written like this in the source)

70% of the time she makes her thumbnails on her PC through Photoshop, and 30% of the time she makes them on her smartphone through ibisPaint.

Her favorite thumbnail is the one used for her third Super Ghouls 'N Ghost stream. 

She said that she enjoys coming up with new thumbnail ideas and likes seeing everyone's reactions to them.

There are quite a lot of people within Nijisanji who praise her thumbnail-making skills.
Here are some of the comments by other streamers:

Takamiya Rion: I like the thumbnails from these parts (when she Lulu still new), Ah, these are irresistably good!
Maimoto Keisuke: Suzuhara Lulu is talented when it comes to making thumbnails.
Debidebi Debiru: I like the images this girl makes so much.
Lize Helesta: These are seriously really unique.

[Pink is No Good]
This is what her customer said when she was selling her Kirby painting. Hearing such criticism was shocking to her and the viewers.

[Youtube Gaming Week]

・VTuber Fall Guys Party (I might include a comprehensive Lulu Fall Guys Data in the future, something that the Japanese wiki doesn't have)
She participated in a Fall Guys tournament featuring 26 VTubers including herself, and her team is named くるみわり/Kurumiwari(literally means nutcracker in Japanese), comprising their names: Ku-zuha, Lu-lu, Mi-nato, Hima-wari.

In the tournament, Honma Himawari won two crowns by herself, and the team won by a landslide, outdoing the 2nd place team by 16 points. (here's the link for her reaction when their victory is announced.) Her level of excitement was exceedingly higher than usual and she let out a shout for joy, something that's very rarely seen from her streams.

・Try! PS5
She participated in a sneak peek of the PS5, along with her colleague Mayuzumi Kai. The project consisted of various popular Japanese Youtubers, including Hikakin and Hanae Natsuki (a very popular Japanese voice actor, Tanjiro's VA).
